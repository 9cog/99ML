# **The Holistic Metamodel in Cognitive Science: Understanding Relevance Realization**

The holistic metamodel for self-organizing systems provides a profound framework for understanding how cognitive systems realize relevance—the fundamental capacity to identify what matters in any given situation. This interpretation bridges the gap between biological organization and cognitive function, revealing how consciousness and intelligence emerge from the same organizational principles that characterize all living systems.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

## **The Core Problem of Relevance Realization**

Relevance realization represents one of the most fundamental challenges in cognitive science: how do limited beings in a vast, ill-defined world determine what is relevant for their goals and survival? This problem transcends simple information processing because it requires the transformation of **semantics into syntax**—turning the meaningful but ambiguous features of the large world into well-defined problems that can be systematically addressed.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

Unlike algorithmic systems that operate in predefined "small worlds" where all problems are well-defined, living cognitive agents must first **frame their problems** before they can solve them. This fundamental framing capacity cannot be captured by purely computational approaches because it is the very process by which formalization occurs.[^4][^1]

## **The Triadic Structure of Relevance Realization**

Holistic Metamodel of Relevance Realization in Cognitive Science

The holistic metamodel reveals that relevance realization emerges from a **triadic dialectic** (trialectic) involving three co-constituting elements that continuously generate and transform each other:[^1]

### **Goals and Intrinsic Motivation**

Arising from the **autopoietic** organization of living systems, goals represent the self-determined objectives that emerge from organizational closure. These are not externally imposed purposes but intrinsic drives that stem from the system's need to maintain its own existence and organization. In cognitive systems, this manifests as the fundamental motivation to make sense of the world, to learn, and to maintain cognitive coherence.[^1][^5][^6][^7][^8]

The autopoietic foundation means that cognitive goals are **self-referential** and **hierarchically organized**—each goal exists within a network of mutually supporting objectives that collectively maintain the system's identity. This creates what Robert Rosen called "immanent causation," where the system becomes the cause of its own stability and development.[^6][^9][^1]

### **Actions and Behavioral Repertoire**

Guided by **anticipatory** processes, actions represent the system's capacity to project current states into potential futures and select appropriate behavioral strategies. This involves sophisticated internal modeling that allows the system to assess the likely consequences of different actions before committing to them.[^1][^10][^11]

Anticipatory systems possess **predictive internal models** that need not be explicit representations but can manifest as evolved automatisms, learned heuristics, or embodied expectations. These models create what Vervaeke calls "Simon's scissors"—the necessary fit between internal cognitive tools and external environmental structure.[^3][^12][^1]

### **Affordances and Environmental Opportunities**

Through **adaptive** coupling with the environment, affordances represent what the world offers to the agent—opportunities and constraints that are neither purely objective features nor subjective projections but **transjective** phenomena arising from agent-environment interaction. An affordance landscape is continuously co-constructed through the exploratory activity of the agent.[^1][^2]

## **Opponent Processing as the Mechanism of Relevance**

The triadic dynamic operates through **opponent processing**—a meta-heuristic approach where complementary or antagonistic strategies are played against each other to evaluate progress toward goals. This creates a dialectical tension that drives the system toward increasingly adequate solutions through trade-offs between:[^1][^3][^13][^14]

- **Exploration versus exploitation** of environmental opportunities
- **Generalization versus specialization** in cognitive strategies
- **Focusing versus diversifying** attention and resources
- **Efficiency versus resilience** in system organization[^3][^1]

This opponent processing is fundamentally different from simple cybernetic feedback because it involves **hierarchical cycles** of interacting processes that preserve their own pattern of interrelations across multiple scales of space and time.[^5][^1]

## **The Three Levels of Cognitive Organization**

The holistic metamodel identifies three nested levels of organization that collectively enable relevance realization:[^1]

### **Level 1: Autopoietic Self-Manufacture**

The foundational level involves **organizational closure**—the self-referential pattern where each component process is generated by and generates other component processes within the same organization. In cognitive systems, this manifests as:[^1][^5][^15]

- **Metabolic maintenance** of neural structures and processes
- **Boundary regulation** between self and environment
- **Identity preservation** through continuous self-production
- **Intrinsic goal generation** from system organization[^6][^1]


### **Level 2: Anticipatory Modeling**

The intermediate level involves **predictive processing** where the system develops internal models of itself and its environment to guide action selection. This includes:[^1][^10]

- **Internal model construction** based on experience
- **Prediction error minimization** through active inference
- **Action selection** based on anticipated outcomes
- **Learning and adaptation** of predictive models[^16][^1]


### **Level 3: Adaptive Agent-Arena Coupling**

The highest level involves the **ecological relationship** between agent and environment, where both co-evolve through mutual interaction. This encompasses:[^1][^2]

- **Niche construction** through environmental modification
- **Affordance landscape evolution** through exploration
- **Ecological rationality** in strategy selection
- **Co-evolutionary dynamics** between agent and world[^17][^18][^1]


## **Relevance Realization as Embodied Rationality**

The holistic metamodel reveals that **rationality is not purely logical** but fundamentally **embodied and ecological**. True rationality means "doing the appropriate thing" in a pragmatic sense—selecting actions most productive toward goal attainment given both the affordance landscape and available repertoire of actions.[^1][^2][^3]

This **embodied bounded rationality** extends beyond human cognition to characterize all living systems. Even a bacterium navigating chemical gradients demonstrates relevance realization by distinguishing between beneficial and harmful environmental features relative to its survival goals. The difference between bacterial chemotaxis and human problem-solving is one of complexity rather than fundamental kind.[^7][^8][^1]

## **Implications for Understanding Consciousness and Intelligence**

The metamodel suggests that **consciousness, cognition, and agency** represent successive elaborations of the same basic organizational principles. As systems develop more sophisticated internal models capable of representing other minds and themselves, higher-order forms of self-reference emerge that may constitute the basis of conscious awareness.[^1][^19][^7][^20][^21]

This progression follows the spiral of self-organization, where each level of complexity creates conditions for the emergence of the next:

1. **Basic agency** through autopoietic organization
2. **Simple cognition** through anticipatory modeling
3. **Complex cognition** through recursive self-modeling
4. **Consciousness** through self-referential awareness
5. **Meta-consciousness** through models of one's own modeling processes[^20][^1]

## **The Impossibility of Purely Computational Cognition**

The holistic metamodel demonstrates why **relevance realization cannot be fully algorithmic**. Since relevance realization is the process of formalization itself—the transformation of ill-defined semantic problems into well-defined syntactic ones—it cannot be completely captured by any formal system without infinite regress.[^1][^2][^4]

This connects to **Gödel's incompleteness theorems** and Rosen's complexity theory: just as sufficiently complex formal systems must remain incomplete, living cognitive systems operating in large worlds cannot be completely formalized. The capacity for relevance realization represents a form of **radical emergence** that transcends purely computational explanations.[^9][^17][^1]

## **Applications to Artificial General Intelligence**

Understanding relevance realization through the holistic metamodel has profound implications for artificial intelligence research. Current AI systems operate in predefined "small worlds" where relevance is pre-specified, but genuine artificial general intelligence would require systems capable of autonomous problem framing and relevance realization.[^1][^22][^23]

The CogPrime architecture represents one attempt to create such systems through **cognitive synergy**—the integration of multiple cognitive processes in ways that enable mutual assistance and support. This approach recognizes that intelligence emerges from the dynamic interaction between diverse cognitive components rather than from any single algorithmic approach.[^19][^23]

## **The Embodied Nature of Mind**

The metamodel emphasizes that **mind is fundamentally embodied and ecological**. Cognitive processes cannot be understood in isolation from the biological organization that gives rise to them or the environmental context in which they operate. This challenges traditional computational approaches that treat cognition as disembodied information processing.[^1][^7][^8][^24][^25]

Instead, the metamodel reveals that **"to live is to know"**—the capacity for knowledge and meaning-making is intrinsically connected to the self-organizing, self-maintaining, and self-transforming nature of living systems. This understanding bridges biological and cognitive sciences, showing how intelligence represents a natural extension of the organizational principles that characterize all life.[^7][^26][^27][^1]

The holistic metamodel thus provides a unified framework for understanding how relevance realization—the most fundamental cognitive capacity—emerges from the self-organizing dynamics of living systems, offering insights into the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and the possibilities for creating genuinely autonomous artificial minds.
