## Abstract

What is the metaphysical paradigm of General Systems Theory? Analyzing the major works in GST we find that a common feature is the type of questions asked. Applying concepts to themselves, or asking self-referential recursive questions distinguishes systems thinking from the classical scientific approach. 

Based on the concept of **self-referential recursion** we propose a proto-world hypothesis serving as conceptual framework for the construction of "reality". This ultimate principle is metaphysical, in the sense that it can't be verified nor falsified. 

Any "reality" is an **autognostic process** which can be described as a **hierarchical self-image building system** consisting in the co-evolution of local and global nested hierarchies:

- On each hierarchical level the **local phenomena** map or compute (put together) local "images" of the global phenomena in which they take place
- **Global phenomena** on the other hand map the ensemble of local phenomena into a global "field" or global "image", which differentiates itself under the influence of the contained local phenomena

The organizational categories of the local bottom-up integration and the global top-down differentiation are **isomorph on each hierarchical level**. 

Language and formal systems are special cases of hierarchical self-image building systems based on the same organizational categories as all other natural self-organizing systems. This organizational isomorphism explains the epistemological puzzle: why we can describe natural phenomena in terms of language and formal systems.

## 1. Introduction

Kant said about metaphysics that it was like a dark ocean without shore and without lighthouse (a good reason for not talking about it!). On the other hand the solitary thinker of Koenigsberg also said that if you drive metaphysics out of the front door, it immediately enters through the back door.

Most scientists today pretend to be unaware of this fact: science is their business; philosophy and especially metaphysics are reserved to a few professional "logographs" (as Plato called them). Natural scientists write about philosophical questions only after their retirement or after having been awarded a Nobel prize (e.g. Einstein, Heisenberg, Monod, Eigen, Prigogine to cite only a few). 

What they generally discover a posteriori can be resumed in a single phrase: **any scientific research is based on an implicit world-view**, some sort of conceptual framework, in which one believes, and within which one constructs all further edifices of mental architecture. This conceptual framework is more than the hundred-fold cited Kuhnian paradigm, it is a vague hypothesis about "reality", a sort of **proto-world hypothesis** (Gaines, 1985) which can't be verified nor falsified, in short, a metaphysical paradigm.

## 2. What is the Metaphysical Paradigm of General Systems Theory?

Despite the affirmative title of Ludwig von Bertalanffy's (1968) book "General Systems Theory", we pretend that no coherent General Systems Theory exists. GST can be considered as an agglomerate of diverse bodies of knowledge elaborated by scientists who share a common belief: which?

Since there exists no such thing as a coherent GST as a consequence there exists no single body of knowledge which could be called a coherent Systems Philosophy. Today's systems philosophical landscape can be described as a savanna with single trees standing out here and there and some inevitable botanists wandering round, re-drawing summary pictures of the trees in their papers and classifying the trees into species like Emergentism, Structuralism, and Organicism (Bahms, 1984a, 1984b, 1985).

Others ask questions of the type: "Systems of philosophy or Philosophy of Systems?" (Sadovsky, 1985).

Let us have a closer look at the structure of this question:

**System of Philosophies (or) Philosophy of Systems?**

A self-referential recursive loop! What is of what? Is X the object of subject Y, or is Y the object of subject X? Maybe the answer to our question on the metaphysical paradigm of GST is a question? What is the common belief of GST researchers? Von Bertalanffy (1968) would say the unity of science, Battista (1977) speaks of a "Holistic paradigm". We think that the concept of unity of all phenomena describes only partly the common underlying GST paradigm. The concept of "holon" (Bahm, 1984a) comprises also a certain type of relations between "holons" of discrete hierarchical levels.

### Proposition 1

**The common metaphysical paradigm of GST is to formulate questions in terms of self-referential recursive loops.**

Let us analyze a sample of research works which have significantly influenced General Systems Thinking under this aspect of recursive self-application of concepts:

Mathematical thought always seems to be a precursor of concepts, which find their way into the disciplines after a certain time-lag.

- **The provability of proofs?** Metasystems (Gödel, 1931)
- **The computability of computation?** Abstract automata (Turing, 1936)

Cybernetics introduce self-referential recursive thought into the natural sciences:

- **The control of control?** Cybernetics (Wiener, 1948)
- **The observation of observation?** Self-referential systems (von Foerster, 1973)
- **The organization of organization?** Autopoiesis (Varela, 1979)
- **The evolution of evolution?** Hypercycles (Eigen, 1971)
- **The order of order?** Synergetics (Haken, 1977)
- **The morphogenesis of morphogenesis?** Catastrophe theory (Thom, 1972)
- **The system of systems?** Living systems (Miller, 1978)
- **The hierarchy of hierarchies?** Holons (Koestler, 1967)
- **The complexity of complexity?** Organized complexity (von Bertalanffy, 1968)
- **The method of method?** Complexity (Morin, 1977, 1980)

## 3. The Autognostic Process

### Core Principle

The **autognostic process** is the fundamental mechanism by which reality constructs itself through hierarchical self-image building. It operates through the **co-evolution of local and global nested hierarchies**.

### Dual Process Architecture

#### Bottom-Up Integration (Local → Global)

Local phenomena at each hierarchical level compute or map local "images" of the global phenomena in which they are embedded. This is an **integrative process** where:

1. Local components perceive their global context
2. They create internal representations (images) of that context
3. These images guide local behavior and adaptation
4. The collective of local images influences the global field

#### Top-Down Differentiation (Global → Local)

Global phenomena map the ensemble of local phenomena into a global "field" or "image", which differentiates itself under the influence of the contained local phenomena. This is a **differentiating process** where:

1. The global field emerges from the totality of local phenomena
2. This field creates constraints and affordances for local behavior
3. The field differentiates in response to local variations
4. Global patterns influence local development

### Organizational Isomorphism

**Key Insight:** The organizational categories of local bottom-up integration and global top-down differentiation are **isomorph on each hierarchical level**.

This means:
- The same organizational principles operate at all scales
- Physical systems, biological systems, cognitive systems, and social systems share the same fundamental architecture
- Language and formal systems are **special cases** of this universal pattern

This explains the **epistemological puzzle**: We can describe natural phenomena in terms of language and formal systems because they share the same organizational structure.

## 4. Hierarchical Self-Image Building

### The Recursive Structure

At each level of organization:

1. **Local Image Formation**
   - Local entities construct images of their global context
   - These images are **self-referential** (the system knows itself)
   - Images guide behavior and enable anticipation

2. **Global Field Emergence**
   - The global field emerges from local interactions
   - It provides context and constraints for local behavior
   - The field is itself an image of the collective local states

3. **Recursive Closure**
   - Local images influence global field
   - Global field influences local images
   - System achieves **operational closure** through this recursion

### Self-Reference and Autonomy

The system becomes **self-referential** when:
- The object (physical structure) and its image (representation) converge
- The system is its own reference
- It achieves operational closure (no need for external logical connection)

The degree of self-reference equals the level of **self-knowledge** or **consciousness**.

## 5. Connection to Third-Order Cybernetics

### Integration with Schwarz's Three Planes

The autognostic process operates across all three planes:

#### Physical Plane (Material Objects)
- Local: Individual material components
- Global: Physical field structures
- Process: Matter-energy transformations

#### Information Plane (Relations)
- Local: Individual network connections
- Global: Connectivity patterns and information flows
- Process: Self-organization and communication

#### Existential Plane (Being/Wholeness)
- Local: Individual self-models
- Global: Collective identity and autonomy
- Process: **Self-reference and autognosis**

### The Existential Plane as Autognostic Domain

The **existential plane** is where autognosis manifests most clearly:

1. **Self-Reference Cycle (Stabilizing)**
   - System maintains its own identity through recursive self-imaging
   - Operational closure achieved
   - Consciousness emerges from self-reference degree

2. **Autogenesis Cycle (Creative)**
   - System creates itself through self-image building
   - Autonomy develops through recursive self-construction
   - New levels of organization emerge

### Dual Process Architecture Connection

Winiwarter's dual process (bottom-up integration, top-down differentiation) maps directly to the existential plane's operations:

- **Bottom-up:** Local self-models integrate into global identity
- **Top-down:** Global identity differentiates into local self-awareness
- **Recursive:** Both processes occur simultaneously at all levels

## 6. Implications for Cognitive Architecture

### Hierarchical Self-Model Construction

The autognostic process provides a theoretical foundation for:

1. **Multi-level Self-Representation**
   - System maintains self-images at multiple scales
   - Each level constructs images of levels above and below
   - Coherence emerges from organizational isomorphism

2. **Consciousness as Self-Knowledge**
   - Consciousness = degree of self-reference
   - Higher self-reference = deeper self-knowledge
   - Achieved through recursive image building

3. **Operational Autonomy**
   - System becomes its own reference
   - No external validation needed
   - True autonomy through self-containment

### Language and Formal Systems

Language and formal systems share the autognostic architecture:

- They are hierarchical self-image building systems
- Same organizational categories as natural systems
- This explains our ability to describe nature formally

## 7. Key Concepts Summary

### Autognosis
The process of self-knowledge through hierarchical self-image building. A system knowing itself by constructing recursive self-referential representations.

### Hierarchical Self-Image Building
The dual process of:
- Local entities creating images of global context (integration)
- Global fields creating images of local ensembles (differentiation)
- Operating isomorphically at all hierarchical levels

### Organizational Isomorphism
The same organizational principles operate at all scales and in all domains (physical, biological, cognitive, social, linguistic).

### Self-Reference
The recursive closure where the system becomes its own reference, achieving operational autonomy. Degree of self-reference equals level of consciousness/self-knowledge.

### Proto-World Hypothesis
The metaphysical assumption that reality is fundamentally an autognostic process - a self-referential recursive construction rather than a pre-given objective structure.

## 8. Connection to Existing Implementation

### Integration Points with Third-Order Cybernetics Code

The current implementation (`third_order_cybernetics.h/c`) already contains structures that align with autognosis:

#### Existential Plane Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    neural_tensor_t* self_model;        // System's model of itself
    neural_tensor_t* identity_state;    // Emergent identity
    float autonomy_level;               // Degree of autonomy
    bool self_aware;                    // Self-awareness flag
} existential_plane_t;
```

This can be enhanced with:
- Hierarchical self-image stack (multiple levels)
- Local-to-global integration mechanisms
- Global-to-local differentiation mechanisms
- Self-reference degree metric (consciousness level)

#### Self-Reference Cycle
Already defined as `CYCLE_SELF_REFERENCE` but can be enhanced with autognostic mechanisms:
- Recursive image building
- Convergence of object and image
- Operational closure tracking

## Implementation Notes

This document provides the theoretical foundation for implementing autognostic processes in the existential plane of the third-order cybernetics model. The key innovation is recognizing that **self-reference** (already present in the model) is fundamentally an **autognostic process** - a hierarchical self-image building system operating through dual processes of local-global integration and global-local differentiation.

The implementation should maintain organizational isomorphism across all hierarchical levels, ensuring that the same fundamental patterns operate at physical, informational, and existential planes.
