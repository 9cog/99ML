## Extended Definitions from Schwarz's Holistic Metamodel

This comprehensive extension provides detailed conceptual definitions from Eric Schwarz's third-order cybernetics framework, grounded in his holistic epistemology and the Space's instructions on self-organizing systems.

### Primal Categories and Fundamental Concepts

**Energy (Physical Plane)**[^1]
Energy represents the conserved invariant that constitutes objects, matter, and all physical interactions in space and time. In Schwarz's framework, energy is not merely a physics concept but a universal principle that operates across atomic systems, biological organisms, and socioeconomic systems alike. Energy manifests as both actual material flows and potential capacities for transformation within systems. The physical plane encompasses structures, components, material exchanges, and all measurable quantity transformations.

**Relations (Information Plane)**[^1]
Relations constitute the immaterial network of potential causation immanent in material structures. Unlike the mechanist paradigm which attempts to reduce relations to material particles (gravitons, photons), Schwarz recognizes relations as fundamentally distinct from matter-energy. Relations represent the abstract logical organization, the network of possible future states, and the causal connectivity that emerges from physical interactions. This network is not external to systems but embedded within their organization—it exists as the field of probabilities governing which physical state will actualize next. Relations are on equal ontological footing with objects, yet they remain immaterial until actualized through physical processes.

**Wholeness/Being (Existential Plane)**[^1]
The existential plane encompasses the emerging holistic properties of a system as an integrated whole. This represents the synthesis beyond mere aggregation of parts—the system as a unified entity with its own identity and autonomous being. Wholeness cannot be reduced to component analysis; it emerges from the ontological dialogue between physical structures and relational networks. This plane represents what Schwarz calls "existential totality"—the system recognizing itself as an entity rather than a collection of interacting components.

### The Minimal System Architecture

**The Triad**[^1]
Schwarz proposes that the most fundamental existing entity is the minimal system: two interacting components producing one emergent whole. This triad constitutes a non-separable entity defined by both its parts and their relations. Any observable phenomenon—from atomic interactions to social formations to conscious observation itself—instantiates this triadic structure. The triad represents the basic building block from which all complexity derives through iteration and integration.

**Prototypical System**[^1]
A system is an organized whole of interacting components characterized by operational closure and emergent properties. Systems exist as matrices where physical interactions continuously engage with potential relations, actualizing certain possibilities while foreclosing others. The system maintains its identity through continuous internal dynamics rather than external constraint.

### The Spiral of Self-Organization: Seven Steps

**0. Entropic Drift**[^1]
The natural trend of a parent system toward disorder, uniformity, and actualization of its existing potentialities. Entropic drift represents the tendency toward the more probable, formalized by increasing entropy in simple systems and Popperian propensions in complex systems. This drift destabilizes existing configurations, creating conditions far from equilibrium that enable morphogenetic restructuring. The drift emerges not from external force but from the intrinsic nature of the system moving toward probable states.

**1. Morphogenesis (Self-Formation)**[^1]
The emergence of new structures through differentiation of undifferentiated media, triggered by positive feedback loops operating far from equilibrium. Morphogenesis represents order through fluctuation—the amplification of local variations into global pattern differentiation. Dissipative structures arise as organized complexity emerges from chaos. This cycle is fundamentally creative, generating novel forms and patterns that did not previously exist in the system.

**2. Vortices (Self-Propagation)**[^1]
Circular physical cycles in space and time that establish sustainable flows between differentiated components. Vortices encompass ecological recycling, metabolic circulation, cardiac oscillations, and all periodic exchanges of energy and matter. The defining characteristic is circularity—the system must complete closed loops to maintain its material exchanges. Vortices ensure matter and energy continuously recirculate rather than being exhausted. These constitute the first necessary condition for system perennity—without cyclical exchange, the system dissipates.

**3. Homeostasis/Retroaction (Self-Regulation)**[^1]
Cybernetical feedback networks, predominantly negative loops, that maintain functional stability by regulating variations. Homeostasis requires compatibility between physical flows in the energy plane and the corresponding causal network in the information plane. Negative feedback loops preserve the system's state near its goal by adjusting for deviations. Homeostasis belongs to the relational plane—it is the abstract control mechanism imaging and responding to physical processes.

**4. Autopoiesis (Self-Production)**[^1]
The self-producing circularity where the organism produces its own causality network, and the causality network produces the organism—a "super-circularity" transcending mere homeostasis. Autopoiesis represents the logic of life: the system's structure and organization mutually produce each other continuously. The organism incarnates a causality network whose product is precisely the physical exchanges that generated it. This represents the first emergence of operational closure: a living system needs no external reference for its reproduction. Autopoiesis connects the physical plane and information plane in mutual production.

**5. Self-Reference (Self-Knowledge)**[^1]
The recursive dialogue where the system becomes its own reference point, requiring no external logic for validation or correction. Self-reference emerges when the physical structure (brain, organism) and its immanent virtual network (mind, logical organization) achieve sufficient congruence that the system knows its own state and future possibilities. The degree of self-reference directly correlates with the level of consciousness: stronger alignment between actual structure and potential futures indicates deeper self-knowledge. Operationally closed self-referential systems have no logical connection with external systems.

**6. Autogenesis (Self-Creation)**[^1]
The ultimate cycle representing the autonomous impact of the system as a whole upon its own autopoietic production process. Autogenesis confers genuine autonomy—the capacity to create and revise one's own laws of production. An autonomous system is not merely following programmed rules; it generates the rules governing its own behavior. This represents meta-coupling: the system as emergent whole feeds back upon its own self-production processes, enabling genuine novelty and intentional change.

### The Six Cycles of Viable Systems

**Three Stabilizing Cycles (Horizontal - Within Planes)**[^1]

- **Vortices (Cycle 2)**: Matter recycling within the physical plane
- **Homeostasis (Cycle 3)**: Functional regulation within the relational plane
- **Self-Reference (Cycle 5)**: Autonomous identity within the existential plane

These provide structural stability, enabling the system to persist while maintaining consistency.

**Three Creative Cycles (Vertical - Between Planes)**[^1]

- **Morphogenesis (Cycle 1)**: Creative emergence from physical plane toward new structures
- **Autopoiesis (Cycle 4)**: Creative production connecting physical and information planes
- **Autogenesis (Cycle 6)**: Creative autonomy emerging from totality plane back to production

These enable transformation and adaptation, allowing the system to evolve and respond to changed conditions.

### Ontological Categories

**Non-Dualist Ontology**[^1]
Schwarz replaces Cartesian dualism (mind/matter, subject/object) with holistic non-dualism recognizing three irreducible but inseparable categories: objects, relations, and wholes. Unlike physicalist materialism that privileges matter as the only fundamental reality, non-dualism treats all three categories as equally real and ontologically primitive. Objects exist; relations exist; emergent wholes exist. None reduces to the others.

**Operational Closure**[^1]
A system is operationally closed when it produces and maintains its own organization independent of external direction. Completely closed systems require no external logical connection with their environment. Real Earth systems are only partially autonomous—they need each other—but the principle of operational closure defines the degree of autonomy and self-determination a system achieves.

**Emergent Properties**[^1]
Holistic properties that arise from collective cooperative effects and cannot be deduced from component analysis alone. Life, consciousness, and autonomy exemplify emergent properties dependent on both structural complexity and logical organization. Understanding emergent properties requires systemic perspective rather than reductionist decomposition.

### Epistemological Distinctions

**Heteronomous Systems**[^1]
Systems ruled by fixed external invariant laws with no internal self-organization. Objects in heteronomous systems follow predetermined laws unchanged by the objects' movements—the classical case of Newton's mechanics or Maxwell's electromagnetism. These systems have no internal circularity and can be fully anticipated from external laws.

**Autonomous Systems**[^1]
Systems where the equations themselves change with system evolution. In autonomous systems, especially social, living, and conscious systems, the relations are not permanent but contingent on the system's current configuration. Laws emerge from system organization rather than existing eternally external to systems.

**Potential Relations vs. Actual Interactions**[^1]
Actual interactions are concrete material exchanges occurring in real space-time. Potential relations are the immaterial network of possible next states residing within the system's organization. The permanent dialogue between actuality and potentiality constitutes the fundamental dynamic of complex systems. This distinction is crucial: confusing symbols of a theory (human artifacts) with actual potential relations (part of nature) leads to mechanist errors.

### Consciousness and Self-Reference

**Consciousness**[^1]
The existential property emerging from the self-referential dialogue between the brain (as material structure in the energy plane) and the mind (as immaterial network in the information plane). Consciousness increases in degree as the object (brain) and its image (mental potential) become more similar—more self-referential. The system exists as a unified whole rather than a dualistic mind-body combination. Consciousness is not an illusion; it represents genuine ontological emergence from autopoietic processes achieving sufficient self-reference.

**Mind**[^1]
The immanent virtual network of relations specifying possible future states of the brain. Unlike dualist tradition which locates mind as separate from body, in Schwarz's framework mind is the informational pattern incarnated within the brain's physical organization—like a blueprint existing within the machine itself rather than on an external document.

**Brain**[^1]
The physical material structure materializing the network of immaterial virtual relations. The brain is not merely executing pre-written programs but continuously actualizing potentials from its own immanent relational network.

### Value Systems and Existential Drift

**Existential Drift Toward Existence**[^1]
The third fundamental drift alongside entropic drift and informational drift, representing the tendency of systems toward greater autonomy and self-identity. As systems evolve from heteronomous to autonomous, they develop stronger existential presence—clearer identity, greater self-reference, deeper being. Consciousness itself represents an advanced manifestation of existential drift.

**Paradigm**[^1]
An unstated assumption everyone shares because it appears unnecessary to state—the fundamental invisible framework through which a society interprets reality. Paradigms are extremely difficult to change because they determine what appears obvious or impossible. Transcending paradigms requires recognizing that what seems like direct reality is actually a particular interpretive framework among many possibilities.

### System Intervention and Leverage Points

**Leverage Points**[^1]
Positions within complex systems where small local actions can produce large systemic changes. Schwarz extends Donella Meadows' framework, situating leverage points across three planes: physical interventions (constants, buffers, flow structures), relational interventions (feedback loops, information networks), and existential interventions (rules, self-organization capacity, system goals, paradigms, and metacognitive awareness).

**Systemic Methodology**[^1]
The practice of understanding complex systems through their natural dynamics and intervening accordingly. Rather than imposing external control, systemic methodology identifies how systems self-organize and works with these tendencies rather than against them. Effective intervention requires understanding whether one is addressing physical structures, relational organizations, or existential patterns.

### Invariance and Evolution

**Invariants**[^1]
Features that persist despite systemic change. In Schwarz's framework, energy (as conserved quantity), homeostatic negative feedback loops (as relational feature), and the tendency toward self-organization represent universal invariants across all viable systems regardless of material substrate. These invariants enable general laws across diverse domains—from atomic to social to conscious systems.

**Potentialities and Propensions**[^1]
The inherent possibilities residing within a system, representing what Schwarz calls "Popperian propensions" following Karl Popper. Rather than fixed predetermined futures, complex systems carry multiple potential futures within their current organization. The actualization of potentialities constitutes the fundamental dynamics of system evolution.

### Dialogical Principles

**Ontological Dialogue**[^1]
The continuous reciprocal interaction between physical structures and relational networks. Rather than one determining the other, they exist in constant creative dialogue—each shaping and reshaping the other through the system's evolution. This dialogue is fundamental rather than derivative; it constitutes the basic dynamic of existence.

**Autopoietic Dialogue**[^1]
The specific form of ontological dialogue characteristic of living systems, where material structures and logical organization mutually produce each other. The organism produces its own causality network through its physical exchanges; the causality network produces the organism through its actualization. This reciprocal production defines the logic of life.

These extended definitions provide the conceptual vocabulary necessary for understanding Schwarz's holistic metamodel as a framework for interpreting self-organizing systems across all domains of complexity.[^1]
